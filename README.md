    Makefile    compiles SLIP_LU and its dependencies

Dependencies (all part of SuiteSparse):

    AMD                 approximate minimum degree ordering
    COLAMD              column approximate minimum degree ordering
    SuiteSparse_config  configuration for all of SuiteSparse

Default instalation locations:

    include
    lib
    share
